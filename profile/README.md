### 25-2 Hanyang University Software Engineering Project

FoS is an LG display–linked real-time meeting AI prompter that transforms a traditional teleprompter into an active, context-aware assistant. It supports the entire lifecycle of presentations and meetings – before, during, and after – by listening to speech, understanding context, and surfacing the next required information on LG displays and personal dashboards.

## 💡 Proposal

We introduce **FoS (Focus on Speaking)**, a real-time AI meeting prompter designed to reduce cognitive overload during presentations and discussions.  
Modern speakers must manage speech delivery, scripts, slide transitions, time, and audience reactions simultaneously, while participants struggle to track ideas, decisions, and follow-up tasks. This often leads to **omitted content, topic drift, unclear decisions, and reduced meeting efficiency.**

FoS addresses these issues by integrating **real-time STT, semantic speech–script alignment (KoSentence-BERT + LLM), dual-screen teleprompter architecture, and a structured meeting-intelligence system.**

When key content is skipped, FoS detects omissions, suggests natural bridging sentences, and automatically highlights the correct script segment. Meanwhile, the shared LG display visualizes the **agenda map, decisions, action items, and fact-checks**, while the presenter sees a private dashboard of pace, progress, and AI suggestions.

From an organizational perspective, FoS converts raw speech into **structured, reusable meeting knowledge**. Utterances are tagged by intent (idea, decision, action item, question), organized into a real-time agenda graph, and exported as a **Meeting Summary Report**.  
This enhances documentation quality, meeting recall, and long-term decision tracking.

By integrating tightly with **LG Smart Office (webOS, One:Quick, signage)** and cloud AI services, FoS provides a practical, extensible platform for more focused presentations and smarter meetings.
