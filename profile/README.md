### 25-2 Hanyang University Software Engineering Project

**Focus on Speaking(FoS)** is an AI-powered real-time presentation and meeting assistant designed to support the speaker’s *“moment of speaking”* without interruption.  
By combining STT-based teleprompting with intelligent meeting visualization, FoS delivers a seamless experience across both presentation and discussion phases.

FoS tracks the speaker’s script progress in real time, highlights where they should be reading, and suggests natural supplementary sentences when important content is unintentionally skipped.  
In meeting mode, FoS automatically structures spoken content into topics, ideas, and decisions, visualizing them as an evolving agenda map so participants can stay aligned and focused.

Through this integrated approach, FoS transforms scattered speech logs into **clear, navigable, and reusable knowledge**, enabling users to concentrate fully on communication rather than managing tools, screens, or notes.

## 💡 Proposal

We introduce **FoS**, an AI-driven assistant designed to reduce cognitive load during presentations and meetings.  
Modern speakers must manage scripts, slides, timing, and audience reactions simultaneously, while meeting participants often struggle to follow shifting topics and track decisions.  
These difficulties frequently lead to **missed content, topic drift, unclear conclusions, and inefficient communication.**

FoS addresses these challenges through:

- Real-time STT  
- Intelligent speech–script alignment  
- Omission detection & AI-based reconstruction  
- Dual-screen teleprompting  
- Structured meeting visualization

When key content is skipped, FoS identifies the omission and proposes natural bridging sentences while keeping the teleprompter aligned.  
On shared displays (e.g., LG One:Quick, signage), FoS visualizes the **agenda graph, decisions, and action items**, while the presenter privately views AI suggestions and speaking progress.

Ultimately, FoS converts raw speech into **organized, actionable meeting knowledge**, enhancing documentation quality, recall, and decision tracking.
