## 💡 Proposal

We introduce **FoS**, an AI-driven assistant designed to reduce cognitive load during presentations and meetings.  
Modern speakers must manage scripts, slides, timing, and audience reactions simultaneously, while meeting participants often struggle to follow shifting topics and track decisions.  
These difficulties frequently lead to **missed content, topic drift, unclear conclusions, and inefficient communication.**

FoS addresses these challenges through:

- Real-time STT  
- Intelligent speech–script alignment  
- Omission detection & AI-based reconstruction  
- Structured meeting visualization

When key content is skipped, FoS identifies the omission and proposes natural bridging sentences while keeping the teleprompter aligned.  
On shared displays (e.g., LG One:Quick, signage), FoS visualizes the **agenda graph, decisions, and action items**, while the presenter privately views AI suggestions and speaking progress.

Ultimately, FoS converts raw speech into **organized, actionable meeting knowledge**, enhancing documentation quality, recall, and decision tracking.
